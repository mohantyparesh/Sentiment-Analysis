# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis means analyzing the sentiment of a given text or document and categorizing the
text/document into a specific class or category (like positive and negative). In other words, we can say
that sentiment analysis classifies any particular text or document as positive or negative. Basically, the
classification is done for two classes: positive and negative. However, we can add more classes like
neutral, highly positive, highly negative, etc.
Sentiment Analysis is also referred as Opinion Mining. Itâ€™s mostly used in social media and customer
reviews data.
